# Lab 1: Set Covering

In the code you can find 2 solutions:
- the greedy one, uploaded by professor
- and my solution

These are the results:

- N = number of sets
- w = weight, number of elements in our sets
- nodes = number of nodes
- bloat = In computer programming, code bloat refers to the presence of program code (source code or machine code) that is perceived as unnecessarily long, slow, or otherwise wasteful of resources.
